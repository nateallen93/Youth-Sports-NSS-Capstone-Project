Repository for Youth Sports NSS Capstone Project

Overview
  
  Youth sports are a vital part of society, and they have a large influence on how children develop as people. To analyze the state of these sports, high school sports data has been collected from a NFHS database which contains participation data for every high school sport in each state dating back to the 2002/2003 school year for both boys and girls. This repository contains the results of analysis done with this data. 
  
  
Motivation

  I was involved in sports constantly as a kid. I played football, basketball, baseball, soccer, golf, tennis, cross-country, and anything else that was physically active and competitive that I had time for. I look back and understand how important those activities were to my health and development as an individual, teaching lessons of hard work, perseverance, fairness, and social skills. The reported decline in participation in youth sports therefore concerns me, and Iâ€™d like to shed some light on the issue.
  
Data Question

  The interesting questions to me are whether or not there is in fact a decline in participation, the scope of the decline(or rise) in participation, the trends in participation in specific sports, and whether these trends are affected by larger societal conditions, and in what way.
